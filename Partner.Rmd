My name is Felix Baez Santiago and I will modify my partner Chris' hw1.

Chris' first commit was adding the hw1 repo to GitHub. The commit ID is 636f74122a877eb5823b8e4ae6204bc779c40b60.

I was able to knit this RMD without error,

I think the idea of GitHub was well explained in class. Its pretty straight.
